Hatchet is a log parsing/presentation program written for 
OpenBSD's PF logs.  The main script, "hatchet", should be 
run every 15 minutes, or as often as you wish.  Depending on 
the size of your logfiles versus the speed of your machine, 
you may wish to tweak how often it runs.

Hatchet uses a series of Perl regexes to match entries from 
the pflog logs.  The log entries are stored in a SQLite 
database file, allowing for highly dynamic queries and 
statistics.  If it finds one it doesn't have a match for, 
it will kick off an email to the system administrator 
(root@localhost) with the details.  This setting can be
modified in the configuration file (hatchet.conf).

Thanks for trying out Hatchet.  Please email me with your 
feedback, compliments, etc.
